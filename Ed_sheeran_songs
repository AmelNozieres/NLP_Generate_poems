"Castle On The Hill"
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then
Take me back to when
I found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right
I was younger then,
Take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
"Dive"
Maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologise for it
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
10,000 rocks on the lake
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
What's your history?
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
Cause I heard you do
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you 
"Shape Of You"
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (mmmm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now (mmmm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date (mmmm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (mmmm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay (mmmm)
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
"Perfect"
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it,
Darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight
No, no, no
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight 
"Galway Girl"
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called, was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to CÃ¨ilidh, singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me, you know
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
Now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm going to put you in a song that I write
About a Galway girl and a perfect night
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl 
"Happier"
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal baby
If you're moving on with someone new
Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier
Aren't you?
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling I am still in love with you
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you 
"New Man"
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I heard he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keeping it real, still looking at your Instagram and I'll be creeping a little
I'll be trying not to double tap, from way back, cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when you used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't superman, just a young boy trying to be loved
So let me give it to you
I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
Your new man rents a house in the burb, and wears a man bag on his shoulder but I call it a purse
Every year he goes to Malaga, with all the fellas, drinks beer but has a six pack, I'm kind of jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors in winter at nighttime, and every time a rap song comes on
He makes a gun sign, says chune, boydem light up the room
But enough about him, girl let's talk about you
You were the type of girl that sat beside the water reading
Eating a packet of crisps but you will never find you cheating
Now you're eating kale, hitting the gym, keeping up with Kylie & Kim
In the back of the club kissing a boy that ain't him
Ok you need to be alone, and if you wanna talk about it you can call my phone
I just thought that I would tell you cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl trying to be loved
So let me give it to you
I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
Baby, I'm not trying to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him I know you're lonely
Please, remember you're still free, to make the choice and leave
And don't call me up you need to show me
I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
Know about me, know, know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, he don't wanna know
"Hearts Don't Break Around Here"
She is the sweetest thing that I know
You should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pot hole, every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
Unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know
That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah
She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell, fill my lungs
Spent my summer time beside her
And the rest of the year the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame
Oh roses roses laid upon your bed spread
Oh my, hold this, oh this, I know
That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Well I found love in the inside
The arms of a woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night that will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
Because from now until I go
Every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah
Every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Yeah yeah yeah
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah 
"What Do I Know?"
Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved
In politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels."
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene,
I know when I have children, they will know what it means
And I'll pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love and understanding positivity
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Saying love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fitting in your jeans
It's love and understanding positivity
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Saying love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene,
You know the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding positivity
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talking about exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Saying love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know? 
"Supermarket Flowers"
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the "Get Well Soon" cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But, mom, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces. It's tearing me up but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive, then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back, he said, "Hallelujah, you're home"
"Nancy Mulligan"
I was twenty four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty two grand kids now growing old
In the house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father but her daddy said, "No
You can't marry my daughter"
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
Well, I met her at Guy's in the second world war
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire, in our old armchairs
You know Nancy I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border 
"Save Myself"
I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles but would you do the same for me
Oh, honestly?
Offered up my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon cause from here it looks the same?
And only scars remain
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
But if I don't then I'll go back to where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving, just like that
Oh I'm here again, between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong, cause I'm not like my mum
Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song, but it helps
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
Or drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself 
"Beautiful People"
We are, we are, we are
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sun down and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're heading downtown
('Round here)
Everybody's looking for a come-up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well
'Cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation, here
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear
That we become
Beautiful people
Drop-top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of
Beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Pre-nups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere
(Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there
(All night)
I'm not fazed by all the lights and flashing cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
We don't fit in well
We are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation here
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear
That we become
Beautiful people
Drop-top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of
Beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Pre-nups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (yeah)
Yeah, that's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful 
"South Of The Border"
She got the mm brown eyes, caramel thighs, long hair, no wedding ring, hey

She got the mm white dress, but when she's wearing less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mm brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing

"Te amo mami, te amo mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream

Push up on me and sweat darling

In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
You never live till you risk your life
You wanna shine, you gotta get more ice
Am I your lover or I'm just your vice?
A little crazy but I'm just your type
You want the lips and the curves, need the whips and the furs
And the diamonds I prefer in my closet his and hers
He want the little mamacita margarita
I think that Ed got a little jungle fever
You are more than
Something boring
Legs open, tongue out, Michael Jordan, ugh
Go exploring, something foreign (Skrrt skrrt)
Bust it open, rain forest, it be pouring
Yeah, kiss me like you need me, rub me like a genie
Pull up to my spot in Lamborghini
'Cause you gotta see me, never leave me
You got a girl that can finally do it all
Drop an album, drop a baby, but I never drop the ball (Ugh)
So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
"Photograph"
Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat
Where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost
Back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home"
"I'm A Mess"
Oh I'm a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end
I can't work it out
How going through the motions
Going through us
And oh I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes
All of my own words
Are all over written on the signs
But you're on my road
Walking me home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna' feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna' fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach
I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions
Hoping you'd stop
And ohhh I've only caused you pain
I know but all of my words will always below
Of all the love you spoke
When you're on my road
Walking me home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna' feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna' fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach
And for how long, I love, my lover
For how long I love my lover
And now, now, for how long, long I love my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I love my lover
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover (and I feel loved)
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover
I feel it all over now, now and I feel loved
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover
Feel it all over now, now, and I feel loved
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover
Feel it all over now, now, and I feel loved
Now, now, for how long, long I love my lover
Feel it all over now, now, and I feel loved
Now, now, for how long I love my lover
Feel it all over now, now, and I feel loved
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover
"Thinking Out Loud"
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, meâI fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way (mmm...)
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
That, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are (oh, oh)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lo-ud
So, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
But maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are
"One"
Tell me that you turned down the man
Who asks for your hand
'Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams and just stay with me?
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes, but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed or just stay with me
Oh, Lord, now
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
"Sing"
It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time lady
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh-Oh-Oh-Ooh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Ooh-Oh
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you
From your head to toe
Oh-Oh-Oh-Ooh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Ooh-Oh
Sing!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Louder!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sing!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing we found love in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said, "It's nice to meet ya."
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila.
I already know she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness,
I'm in deep shit if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now, not
Sobering up we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another
Now she's kissing my mouth
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you
From your head to toe
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Sing!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Louder!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sing!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Can you feel it? All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it? All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it? Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand darling
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Sing!
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh [x7])
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Louder!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Sing!
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
Louder!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Sing!
"Don't"
Ah lahmlahlah
Ah lahmlahlah
I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear."
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jump right in
A week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend.
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10:00.
Baby, bring a lemon and a bottle of gin.
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM.
Baby, if you wanted me then you should've just said."
She's singing
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How I was confused about
Now she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
[Knock knock knock] on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time God knows I'm singing
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah 
"Nina"
I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder
In any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me
Listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And Re: Stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake
So say it again
Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
Oh won't you leave me now
And I've been livin' on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
'Cause that's you and me both Nina
Oh won't you leave me now, now
And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish
Back to the borough with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can't help it
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation 'cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again
Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
Oh won't you leave me now
And I've been livin' on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
'Cause that's you and me both Nina
Oh won't you leave me now, now
Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song
Go oh won't you leave me now
People grow and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back go oh won't you leave me now
Oh Nina, you should go Nina
(Love will come and love will go)
Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh won't you leave me now
(Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)
And I've been livin' on the road Nina
(People grow and fall apart)
But then again you should know Nina
(But you can mend your broken heart)
Cause that's you and me both Nina
(Take it back, go oh won't you leave me now)
Oh won't you leave me now now
"Bloodstream"
I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?
Oh, no, no, don't leave me alone lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn?
Oh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord, forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover
Oh, no, no, don't leave me alone lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn?
Oh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
So tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
"Tenerife Sea"
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love
LumiÃ¨re, darling
LumiÃ¨re over me
LumiÃ¨re, darling
LumiÃ¨re over me
LumiÃ¨re, darling
LumiÃ¨re over me
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, love, love, love
So in love
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in a moment I knew you, Beth
"Runaway"
I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
Wanna run away, run away with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning go
How long you leaving?
Well, dad, just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own
I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I'll tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
This is what I'm gonna do
Gonna run away, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes and when it's morning go
How long you leaving?
Well, dad, just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own
Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back
As I packed my clothes up
My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack, intends to show love
I don't wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold on
Mama was the same
None of us are saints I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna run away
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces and hope that
Things change, but for now I'll leave town with a backpack on my shoulder
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own
"The Man"
No, I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me cause I write the truth
No I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But fuck it, I won't be changing the subject I love it
I'll make your little secret public it's nothing
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot
I think not
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore
Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore
And since you left
I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job
But mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book
I guess I lied in the hook
Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27
I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge
Or did I make a mistake erasing?
It's only therapy
My thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared
But I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit
Take my apology
I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore
"Afire Love"
Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them
My father told me, son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
You're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
He used to sing
Darlin' hold me in your arms
The way you did last night
And we'll lie inside
For a little while here oh
I could look into your eyes
Until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine
And slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine
Our hearts will beat as one
And we set alight
We're afire love
Love, love
Things were all good yesterday
Then the devil took your breath away
Now we're left here in the pain
Black suit black tie standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen
Six years old I remember when
My father told me, son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
You're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
He used to sing
Darlin' hold me in your arms
The way you did last night
And we'll lie inside
For a little while here oh
I could look into your eyes
Until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine
And slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine
Our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight
We're afire love
Love, love
See the love, the love, the love, the love [3x]
My father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my mother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to say hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
(To my brother and my sister, yeah, ah)
My father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing
Hallelujah
To the love, the love, the love, the love
"Take It Back"
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
'Cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label
But didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga
We drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now
And get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine
Like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded
Like a paper weight
At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
Went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination
I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black
When I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet
By just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove
That I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene
Like an opal fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens
Is from now on
I'll be ready to start again
By the end of the song
This is like claiming I handled it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy
Except the NME but I'll be selling
Twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it
This song's from the heart cover the planet
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
And take it back now
Now I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely
You find me
In the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down,
That's how we plan it out
It's time to take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
Mmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
[Album version stops here]
My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that Pulses
Little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams you own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha. 
"Shirtsleeves"
I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You'll be sinking in
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made
I'll hold ya and you'll think of him
And pretty soon you'll be floating away
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in the throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home
When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes [5x]
I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss, bitterness
And I'll drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your make up
I'll never trust you again
You can just be a friend
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in the throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home
When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact is I...
I'm on the way home
I'm on the way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I'm
I'm drowning in the oceans you made
When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
"Even My Dad Does Sometimes"
It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight
Hold on
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say
That death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today
Hold on
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Hold on
Live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
And hold on
"I See Fire"
Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons
If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh
Stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
Oh, should my people fall
Then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns
Then my brothers will die
And as the sky is falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out
Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out) (fire)
And I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin, yeah) (fire)
And I see fire (uh-uh-uh-uh) (fire)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side
"All Of The Stars"
It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star
And thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here
I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wonder, do you see them too?
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing 'Chasing Cars'
And I thought of us
Back to the time
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp-lit streets and knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
Hear the song my heart is beating to?
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
And, oh, I know
And oh, I know, oh
And I know oh oh oh
I can see the stars from America
"English Rose"
Across the sea
By the Tennessee skyline
They told me I'd find my
Hopes and my dreams
But I long to be
In the bed of my true love
Back where I came from
She's waiting for me
So I'll make my way
Through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
I told my dad
On the phone it's amazing
From the straight to the craziest places I've seen
But I long to be
In the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother
He understands me
I'll spend my days
Just travelling and playing shows
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
I met a man
In a bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me, "Son,
You know, I lost my true love
For the same exact reason
That you crossed the sea."
And I found truth
In people I barely know
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose 
"Touch And Go"
Waking up, midnight November
And you're still in my bed
It's kinda rough, 'cause since I met ya
There's things we've never said
So if I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke
Though my soul
Oh, oh, oh, lately I really need to know
How long, how long can we be touch and go
Oh, my soul, oh, oh, oh
How long, how long can we be touch and go
It's not enough to say I want ya
'Cause I'll say anything
I'm holding out to feel without a doubt
I ha... have just been questioning yeah
If I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role
And act like it's never been broke
Though my soul
Oh, oh, oh, lately I really need to know
How long, how long can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh, oh, oh
How long, how long can we be
All of my bones, they scream I'm right
If you're taking me home to stay the night
Darling my soul would heal
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role
And act like it's never been broke, though my soul
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh, oh, oh
How long, how long can we be touch and go
How long, how long can we be touch and go
How long, how long can we be touch and go
"New York"
Ooh, ooh, whoa, oh, oh, oh now now
Five drinks in on Friday night
We only came to dry your eyes
And get you out of your room
Now this bar has closed its doors
I found my hand is holding yours
Do you wanna go home so soon?
Or maybe we should take a ride
Through the night
And sing along to every song
That's on the radio
In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn no, no, no
The sun could rise
Burning all the street lamps out at 3 AM
So, DJ, play it again
Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
And we'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start of everything
If you want a new love in New York
Yesterday gave me a call
Stressing out about it all
Said the world is moving too fast
And you don't know where to begin
'Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in
Only to wind up on the other side
By yourself
And every day
Screaming out
To all the people that you used to know
From a window that looks upon Manhattan skyline
It's just the way that life goes
And you hear it in every song you know
So, DJ, play it again
Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
And we'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start of everything
If you want a new life in New York
And every song that plays
Is just like the day you had
And it's okay to cry
But I'm saying maybe that's a waste of water
You know I'm here for you
In the back of the taxi cab tonight in New York
It's just reached the morning
And you're still in my arms
And we've stopped driving
Down the boulevard
And I just kissed you, darling
I hope you weren't alarmed
It's just the start of everything
That you want: a new love in New York
A new life in New York
"Make It Rain"
When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though
I know this fire brings me pain
Even so
And just the same
Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Make it rain
All seed needs the water
Before it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
And the hunger more profound
Well, I know there can come tears from the eyes
But they may as well all be in vain
Even though
I know these tears come with pain
Even so
And just the same
Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Make it rain
And the seas are full of water
That stops by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur
That never reach the poor
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
And fill the sky
With all that they can drop
When it's time
To make a change
Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Make it rain
Oh, make in rain
"Lay It All On Me"
All alone as you look through the door
Nothing left to see
