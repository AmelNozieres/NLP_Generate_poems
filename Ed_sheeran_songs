"Castle On The Hill"

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down

I was younger then
Take me back to when

I found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right

I was younger then,
Take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

"Dive"

Maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologise for it

I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
10,000 rocks on the lake

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
What's your history?
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
Cause I heard you do

I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you 


"Shape Of You"

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (mmmm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now (mmmm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date (mmmm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (mmmm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay (mmmm)
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you


"Perfect"

I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it,
Darling, you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight

No, no, no

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight 


"Galway Girl"

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs do you want to drink on?

She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called, was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh, singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me, you know

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

My pretty little Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl

Now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night

I walked her home then she took me inside
Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm going to put you in a song that I write
About a Galway girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

My pretty little Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl 


"Happier"

Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier

Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal baby
If you're moving on with someone new

Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier
Aren't you?

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you 

"New Man"

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I heard he's on a new diet and watches what he eats

He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy so that's fine by me

But still, I'm just keeping it real, still looking at your Instagram and I'll be creeping a little
I'll be trying not to double tap, from way back, cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when you used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't superman, just a young boy trying to be loved
So let me give it to you

I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the burb, and wears a man bag on his shoulder but I call it a purse
Every year he goes to Malaga, with all the fellas, drinks beer but has a six pack, I'm kind of jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors in winter at nighttime, and every time a rap song comes on
He makes a gun sign, says chune, boydem light up the room
But enough about him, girl let's talk about you
You were the type of girl that sat beside the water reading
Eating a packet of crisps but you will never find you cheating
Now you're eating kale, hitting the gym, keeping up with Kylie & Kim
In the back of the club kissing a boy that ain't him
Ok you need to be alone, and if you wanna talk about it you can call my phone
I just thought that I would tell you cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl trying to be loved
So let me give it to you

I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not trying to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him I know you're lonely
Please, remember you're still free, to make the choice and leave
And don't call me up you need to show me

I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Know about me, know, know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, he don't wanna know


"Hearts Don't Break Around Here"

She is the sweetest thing that I know
You should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pot hole, every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
Unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah

She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell, fill my lungs
Spent my summer time beside her
And the rest of the year the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame
Oh roses roses laid upon your bed spread
Oh my, hold this, oh this, I know

That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Well I found love in the inside
The arms of a woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night that will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
Because from now until I go

Every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah

Every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Yeah yeah yeah
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah 

"What Do I Know?"

Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved
In politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels."

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene,
I know when I have children, they will know what it means
And I'll pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Saying love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?

Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fitting in your jeans
It's love and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Saying love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?

Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene,
You know the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talking about exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Saying love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?

Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know? 

"Supermarket Flowers"

I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved

Took the "Get Well Soon" cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But, mom, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces. It's tearing me up but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive, then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back, he said, "Hallelujah, you're home"

"Barcelona"

Well get up up on the dancefloor tonight
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both hands upon her waistline
Get on up baby dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it

You and I we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes, and let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona

Well get up up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes, I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you baby, solamente

You and I we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes, and let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Oh Barcelona

So let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona
Las Ramblas, I'll meet you, we'll dance around La Sagrada Familia
Drinking Sangria, mi niña, te amo mi cariño
Mamacita, rica, si tú, te adoro señorita
Los otros, viva la vida
Come on let's be free in Barcelona
Las Ramblas, I'll meet ya, come on and dance with me, in Barcelona
Drinking Sangria, I just want to be in Barcelona
Mamacita, rica, feel that summer breeze in Barcelona
Los otros, viva la vida, siempre vida Barcelona 

"Nancy Mulligan"

I was twenty four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty two grand kids now growing old
In the house that your brother bought ya

On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father but her daddy said, "No
You can't marry my daughter"

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, I met her at Guy's in the second world war
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire, in our old armchairs
You know Nancy I adore ya

From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border 

"Save Myself"

I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles but would you do the same for me
Oh, honestly?

Offered up my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon cause from here it looks the same?
And only scars remain

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

But if I don't then I'll go back to where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving, just like that
Oh I'm here again, between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong, cause I'm not like my mum
Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song, but it helps
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
Or drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself 


"Beautiful People"
(feat. Khalid)

We are, we are, we are

L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sun down and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're heading downtown
('Round here)

Everybody's looking for a come-up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

We don't fit in well
'Cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation, here
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear
That we become

Beautiful people
Drop-top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of
Beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Pre-nups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful

(L.A., mm)

Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere
(Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there
(All night)
I'm not fazed by all the lights and flashing cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

We don't fit in well
We are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation here
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear
That we become

Beautiful people
Drop-top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of
Beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Pre-nups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (yeah)
Yeah, that's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful

(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful 


"South Of The Border"
(feat. Camila Cabello & Cardi B)

She got the mm brown eyes, caramel thighs, long hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way and now I really wanna know your name
She got the mm white dress, but when she's wearing less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mm brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing

I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
"Te amo mami, te amo mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream

So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

He got the mm green eyes, givin' me signs that he really wants to know my name, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way and suddenly I'm glad I came, I
Ven para acá, quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mí, estás temblando
Mm green eyes, taking your time, knowing that we'll never be the same

I love his lips 'cause he says the words
"Te amo mami, te amo mami"
Don't wake up, this love is like a dream

So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

Flawless diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me


You never live till you risk your life
You wanna shine, you gotta get more ice
Am I your lover or I'm just your vice?
A little crazy but I'm just your type
You want the lips and the curves, need the whips and the furs
And the diamonds I prefer in my closet his and hers
He want the little mamacita margarita
I think that Ed got a little jungle fever
You are more than
Something boring
Legs open, tongue out, Michael Jordan, ugh
Go exploring, something foreign (Skrrt skrrt)
Bust it open, rain forest, it be pouring
Yeah, kiss me like you need me, rub me like a genie
Pull up to my spot in Lamborghini
'Cause you gotta see me, never leave me
You got a girl that can finally do it all
Drop an album, drop a baby, but I never drop the ball (Ugh)

So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

"Photograph"

Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat
Where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost
Back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home"

"I'm A Mess"

Oh I'm a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end
I can't work it out
How going through the motions
Going through us
And oh I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes
All of my own words
Are all over written on the signs
But you're on my road
Walking me home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna' feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna' fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions
Hoping you'd stop

And ohhh I've only caused you pain
I know but all of my words will always below
Of all the love you spoke
When you're on my road
Walking me home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna' feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna' fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

And for how long, I love, my lover
For how long I love my lover
And now, now, for how long, long I love my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I love my lover

Now now, for how long, long I love my lover (and I feel loved)
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover
I feel it all over now, now and I feel loved
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover
Feel it all over now, now, and I feel loved
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover
Feel it all over now, now, and I feel loved
Now, now, for how long, long I love my lover
Feel it all over now, now, and I feel loved
Now, now, for how long I love my lover
Feel it all over now, now, and I feel loved
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover
